a continuously added-to collection of my favourite svt fics! will be sorted by (main) couple  :) 

**!** a little disclaimer that I don't condone shipping members (and people in general) irl, and that i just view fanfics as a way to write stories with previously known/established characterization and without having to fully introduce characters. I am very good at differentiating between written characters and real people, which is how should be & something you should reflect upon if you feel unable to do the same thing.
